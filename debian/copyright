 NOTE! This copyright does *not* cover user programs that use kernel services
 by normal system calls - this is merely considered normal use of the kernel,
 and does *not* fall under the heading of "derived work". Also note that the
 GPL below is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, but the instance of
 code that it refers to (the Linux kernel) is copyrighted by me and others who
 actually wrote it.
 .
 Also note that the only valid version of the GPL as far as the kernel is
 concerned is _this_ particular version of the license (ie v2, not v2.2 or v3.x
 or whatever), unless explicitly otherwise stated.
